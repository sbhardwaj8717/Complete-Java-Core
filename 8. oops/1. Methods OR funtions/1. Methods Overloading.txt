						   <--METHOD OVERLOADING-->
						------------------------------
						------------------------------

	The process of making two methods with same name with diffrent parameters is called as method overloading.

	eg::--
			static int name(int a, int b){}
			static int name(int a, int b, int c){}
			static int name(int a, float b){} 
				etc...


	Pass by value::- The methods parameters values are copied to another variable and then copied object is passed.
	---------------


	Pass by Refrence::- An alias or refrence to the actual value or parameter is passed to the method.
	-------------------

Q. Is java a pass by value language or pass by refrence?

ANS::- Java is always a pass by value for primative data types. 
	But for non-primative data types like classes and objects it is pass by refrence.
